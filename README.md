[Premake 5](https://premake.github.io) as its build system, so you can customize your
environment as you wish.

## GNU/Makefile:

```

## Debugging

We all know how annoying C/C++ can be with memory management, so here's a little tool to help. First install Valgrind on your machine via package manager or from the [official website](https://valgrind.org). After that, execute Valgrind with the executable as an argument:

```bash
valgrind --track-origins=yes --verbose ./bin/ToneMapper
```
